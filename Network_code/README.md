# Thread Intelligence Platform for Windows

## Overview

The Thread Intelligence Platform for Windows is a high-performance, Endpoint detection with Malware setection with MD5 and SHA hashes included with heurestic detection and also using the PE HEader analysis , YARA RUles based analysis , scalable network monitoring and cybersecurity tool designed to handle large volumes of network traffic efficiently , Custom IP , port , url , domain and subdomin Block . Utilizing advanced multithreading techniques, this platform ensures real-time monitoring, analysis, and threat detection without compromising on performance. And still under developement !! will be updated regularly.

## Features

``High Performance:`` Leverages multithreading to handle numerous network connections simultaneously, ensuring responsive and efficient processing.

``Real-Time Monitoring:`` Captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time, providing immediate insights and alerts.

``Scalable Architecture:`` Designed to scale with increasing network load, making it suitable for both small and large network environments.

``Enhanced Security:`` Incorporates robust threat detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats.

``User-Friendly Interface:`` Intuitive interface allowing users to interact with the platform seamlessly while it processes network data in the background.

``Comprehensive Logging: ``Detailed logging and monitoring for tracking performance and diagnosing issues.

``Exploit suggestor:`` Which will suggest to patch the vulnerability and misconfiguration within the system being exploited. 

### More Concept Will be Updated Soon !!


## Under Developement stage more updated will add later stay Tuned !!
